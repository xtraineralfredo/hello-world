# hello-world

Hello everyone, 

I'm Alfredo and I'm just getting started here on Github. My plan is to become an expert software developer and make great contributions here on Github, but also to mankind in general. Right now I'm just taking baby steps, but I'm hoping to be off and running in no time!
